# 🗺️ HERE Hackathon 2025 – POI295 Auto-Correction System

## 📌 Project Description

This project was developed for **GuadalaHacks 2025**, organized by HERE Technologies. The challenge focuses on **automating the correction of spatial errors** detected by the **POI295 validation**, which identifies potential inconsistencies in the location of Points of Interest (POIs) on “Multiply Digitised” roads.

The main goal is to eliminate the need for manual intervention through an intelligent system capable of classifying, correcting, and scaling the solution globally.
